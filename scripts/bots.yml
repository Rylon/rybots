# TODO: This can currently only be one map because I was running out of time...
maps:
  - SparseForest
  - Alone
  - Arena

# src_dir can either be a single directory, a list of directories, or a list
# of directories with different src and dest symlink names, depending on the
# layout of the external bot code.
# Git URLs must be HTTPS because Travis CI isn't able to clone over SSH without setting some keys up.
